# Puppeteer examples

A collection of example scripts using Puppeteer.

## Installation

### Requirements

For this to work you will need to have [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/) installed. NPM is distributed with Node.js. Which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get NPM installed on your computer. After installation, run the following command to install Puppeteer.

``` bash
npm install
```

## Running the examples

You can run an example code by typing:

``` bash
npm run start 1
```

and increasing the number to run a different example.

``` bash
npm run start 2
```
